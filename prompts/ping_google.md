# Test Network Connectivity

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:** Run the ping command right now to test network connectivity to Google.

You must execute this exact command immediately:
```bash
ping -c 4 google.com
```

**What this does:**
- Tests if your system can reach google.com
- Sends 4 ping packets (-c 4 flag limits to 4 pings)
- Shows response times and packet loss statistics
- Confirms internet connectivity and DNS resolution

**Expected output:**
- Should show 4 ping responses with times (e.g., "time=15.2ms")
- 0% packet loss indicates good connectivity
- If it fails, there may be network connectivity issues

**Execute the ping command now using the Bash tool.**
